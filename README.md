There is simple project build on micropython on pico 2w MCU where ov7670 camera and ili9341 display included .
Load ov7670.py, ov7670_wrapper.py, ili9341.py and xpt2046.py into mcu memory and everything will work properly.
I used some libraries to make it easier so there are links for them:
ili9341 micropython repository https://github.com/MootSeeker/RPI_Pico_ili9341; 
ov7670 micropython repository https://github.com/Chris-F5/rp2040_micropython_ov7670_driver
